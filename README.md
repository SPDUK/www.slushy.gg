A pretty basic next.js site to show off my AI generated art üñºÔ∏è

## Get started
- Use `node.js` v16+
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`



## Cloudinary API setup
To use the cloudinary API you'll need to get your API keys and then place them into a `.env.local` file to make local development work.
You can see an example of the key names in `.env.local.example` which you can copy & paste into the `.env.local` file and replace the values with your API keys from cloudinary.

Once you deploy you should do the same process with environment variables, setting up the key / values to match your production cloudinary keys.
